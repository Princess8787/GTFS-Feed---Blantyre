# GTFS-Feed---Blantyre
This GTFS feed was generated by Princess Mathebula under the supervision of Dr. Obiora Nnene at the University of Cape Town. 
This was to attempt to meet the need of generating a GTFS feed that will account for the paratransit service nature of continuous stops. Therefore, this serves as a prototype that can be further developed and/or changed to suit the different types of paratransit services.
